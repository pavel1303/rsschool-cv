### About Me

   I worked in the restaurant business for a long time, going from a line presence to a managerial position,
but decided to change the field of activity, as my work ceased to bring me pleasure.
I have been interested in the field of technology for a long time, and decided to start studying with Front-end development, as it combines creativity and programming, and allows you to create something new for the end user.
I have been studying development for a year now, I recently completed Stage 0 from RS Shcool, and of course I continue to study.
